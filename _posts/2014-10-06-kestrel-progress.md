Little activity has been seen with the Kestrel-2 in the past year or so.
Indeed, the last time I made any serious software contribution to the project dates back to the year 2012.
I intend on changing that by hopefully providing more regular blog, if not software, updates.
My hope is that this helps me stay more focused and helps to keep the interest of my followers.

First and foremost, yes, the Kestrel project is still alive.

I will not, however, persue the completion of parts four through seven of my CPU comparison work.
I've long since lost the data from which those articles were created from (my fault, my apologies), and
I wish not to invest the work needed to regenerate the data.
This is a hobby for me, not a doctoral thesis on which my career hinges.  :)
That said, I've made some pretty significant changes to the Kestrel's plans going forward.
I'll be writing about these in separate articles.

Stay tuned.
