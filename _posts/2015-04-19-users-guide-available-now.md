With the recent progress made on the Kestrel-3 emulator, I've decided to start
to maintain the Kestrel documentation as an integral part of the development
process.  Happily, the very first results of this is now available for viewing.

now!](http://leanpub.com/k3ug)

It's OK to view the guide online (there's a "View Online" button you can click
along the left-edge of the page) for free.  However, if you want to donate to
the project, you can do so by purchasing the book.  Besides getting a PDF
version of the document (which supports copying, so you can copy-and-paste if
needed), you'll also get EPub and MOBI format versions as well, so you can read
the book on your mobile reader of choice.

Additionally, you'll be subscribed to a mailing list which gets notified every
time I make an update to the book.  So, as Kestrel work continues and I add
more documentation to the user's guide, you'll be notified every time I publish
the revision.  Since you'll have already paid for your first copy, you'll still
be able to download the PDF, EPub, or MOBI format for the latest revision as
well.
