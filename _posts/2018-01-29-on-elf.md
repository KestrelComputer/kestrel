## Abstract

The Executable and Linkable Format, ELF, is too complex.
Considerable effort is invested to specify the file structure,
yet little effort is invested in specifying normative procedures when working with the file format.
Regrettably,
there currently is no solution to this problem; the standard has spread like mold on bread,
and has permeated every facet of software development on non-Windows platforms.
At best,
you can find tools
which complies with the standard
and which implements the semantics closest to your requirements;
at worst,
you can migrate away from using ELF all-together, but this incurs real development costs.

## ELF On a Shelf

I bet, when ELF first came to be known,
people must have thought the world of it.
Here was a file format which promised to unify loader and linker formats alike,
providing a compatible container for both executables and shared libraries alike,
and which provided this service on a number of different operating systems.

However, while the glossy ads were convincing to what seems like everyone else except me,
actually getting *my* feet wet with this file format proved utterly corrosive.

I found that
the tooling surrounding the standard
must have started relatively simple,
but has since evolved into
a complex and incomprehensible quagmire
of standards and tribal knowledge since then.
This inexorably lead to the platform-specific dependencies and special cases
we see today.
[As it happens, these have real-world costs.](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=exploit+ld.so&t=ffnt&ia=web)

## Conclusion

<a name="realWorldCosts">1</a>:
I originally wanted to link to a single incident I had in mind.
However, upon realizing just how *many* exploits have happened,
I figured I'd show you what a single search query can yield.
It's dumbfounding.
When faced with this evidence,
one *cannot* deny the complex semantics behind ELF
and its relationship with the surrounding operating system
makes the continued reliance upon it a security liability.
