title:  "EDOS: Event Driven Operating System"

Many of my project followers have expressed a desire for an event-driven operating system.
Redesigning STS to meet that challenge is doable; however,
it is unlikely to be a terribly productive use of my time
considering my preference to focus on hardware development this year.
So, I've decided to take the approach of
porting an existing, proven project to deliver an event driven OS.
As a nice side benefit,
it also significantly enhances my current developer toolchain.

## The Name Change

In [a previous article]({{site.baseurl}}/2015/10/11/evented-kernel/),
I described some attributes
of the next major redesign
of the Kestrel-3's initial operating system.
It was to be known as STS V2.

A quick poll on Twitter later revealed
that people preferred a different name.
That's where the name
Event Driven Operating System,
or simply EDOS, came from.

## Foundations for EDOS

As it turns out,
I can meet a huge subset of my desired goals
for the operating system
if I simply reused an already existing product.
Dating from as far back as 1988,
there happened to exist an operating system
built almost entirely around callbacks and a central event loop.

No, this isn't [Contiki](http://www.contiki-os.org/).

I am, of course, talking about
[Project Oberon](http://www.projectoberon.com).

Now, in my travels so far,
two kinds of people rapidly polarize against each other 
with the mere mention of Oberon.
The first group of people are entheusiastic to see it used for something other than an idle curiosity.
This is true even for those who dislike the programming language syntax.
The second group of people are vehemently opposed to it,
often going so far as to offer accusatory or even conspiratorial rhetoric against
its author.
No joke.  It's not at all pretty,
and there seems to be no middle ground. 
If you're in the group of people
who dislikes Modula-2 or Oberon
with such vehemency as to proclaim Professor Wirth a twit,
or even to go so far as to suggest physical harm against him
for having introduced Pascal, Modula, or Oberon,
then you're free to dismiss the Kestrel project forthwith.
Love it or hate it,
this is the foundation I've decided to move forward with.
