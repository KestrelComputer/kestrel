Credits and contributors in alphabetical order, by last name.  If you prefer a
pseudonym, that's OK too:


Brinkhoff, Lars
    Provided .gitattributes for proper Github metrics reporting.

Falvo, Samuel A. II
    Project founder and current visionary.

Ford, Scott
    Designed a really awesome image of a Kestrel's head for use as a logo in
    print and promotional material.  Thanks so much!  You can find his online
    presence at http://haliaeetus123.deviantart.com/ .

FORTH, Inc. (esp. Leon Wagner)
    This excellent company allowed me to rely on the source code to their
    commercial product, SwiftForth 3.6.2, for inspiration and study when I
    was having problems implementing the MARKER word in the Forth interpreter.
    Please extend a hand to Leon Wagner, and support FORTH, Inc. in any way
    you can.  It's the least that we can do to say thank you for their
    contribution.  http://www.forth.com

Stevenson, Scot
    Brought his TASM6502 project to my attention, and let me base vasm on his
    efforts.  Also, let me relicense the work to be compatible with the rest
    of the Kestrel project.  Although eventually superceded with the Python-
    version of the 2-pass assembler, the latter couldn't have existed without
    the former to serve as a reference implementation.


And many, many more whom I've forgotten over the years, because I didn't think
to create this file earlier.  If you wish to be listed and remember your
contribution, please get in touch with me, so I can give due credit!
