Credits and contributors in alphabetical order, by last name.  If you prefer a
pseudonym, that's OK too:


Brinkhoff, Lars
    Provided .gitattributes for proper Github metrics reporting.

Falvo, Samuel A. II
    Project founder and current visionary.

Stevenson, Scot
    Brought his TASM6502 project to my attention, and let me base vasm on his
    efforts.  Also, let me relicense the work to be compatible with the rest
    of the Kestrel project.


And many, many more whom I've forgotten over the years, because I didn't think
to create this file earlier.  If you wish to be listed and remember your
contribution, please get in touch with me, so I can give due credit!
